# DXDemos.Office365 #
DXDemos.Office365 is a solution containing several store patterns and practices. The apps and add-ins in this solution are near store-ready and illustrate a number of interesting patterns.

# Getting Started #
After you clone the Store PnP repo, you should open the web.config and update the configuration with your own values. This includes appsettings values for **ida:ClientID**, **ida:Password**, and **baseUrl**. The DXDemos.Office365 solution also uses DocumentDB (Azure's NoSQL alternative to Mongo). It could be re-factored to to use any data store, but it is easiest to provision a DocumentDB account and update the appsettings for **ddb:endpoint**, **ddb:authKey**, and **ddb:database** (the values checked-in are invalid).

    <!-- The following are AAD settings for the app -->
    <add key="ida:ClientID" value="cb88b4df-db4b-4cbe-be95-b40f76dccb14" />
    <add key="ida:Password" value="c23vRAjoINSuKnj7tEDYCqwi7pN3cXy2pPdOecv54O4=" />
    <add key="ida:AuthorizationUri" value="https://login.microsoftonline.com" />

    <!--baseUrl is used for reply URL in OAuth flows...two listed to handle debug/release-->
    <!--<add key="baseUrl" value="https://dxsamples.azurewebsites.net/" />-->
    <add key="baseUrl" value="https://localhost:44321/" />
    
    <!-- The following are setting for Azure DocumentDB, which is the data store for the app -->
    <add key="ddb:endpoint" value="https://dxdemo.documents.azure.com:443/" />
    <add key="ddb:authKey" value="WkPRneEPSrhCdaEVd30e+ag00pbe8B0Ilzn4idJqakWMtFgz7oFBXlrjZvNTqPKzHG25ZHAwZxJrtydo1gBiAw==" />
    <add key="ddb:database" value="dxdemo" />

When you setup this app in Azure AD, it needs the following permissions: **Access directory as signed-in user** and **Read and Write the signed-in users files**. It also needs **Read and write user mail** from Office 365 Exchange Online** (this is for user pictures, which is currently broken in the Unified API).

# Apps/Add-ins in DXDemos.Office365 #
This section will outline all the apps and add-ins contained in the DXDemos.Office365 solution.
## DXDemos.Office365.MailCRM ##
DXDemos.Office365.MailCRM is a Read Outlook Mail Add-in that functions as a CRM solution with mail. This follows a popular scenario of providing a mail add-in that looks up contact details in another system.

The solution is hosted in a ASP.NET MVC project, but is built as a single-page application (SPA) with AngularJS. Web APIs provide the back-end services and integration with DocumentDB. A single OAuth controller provides the sign-in logic and helps cache the users refresh tokens.
